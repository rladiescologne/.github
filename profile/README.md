## About us 👩‍💻

We are the Cologne chapter of the global [R-Ladies community](https://twitter.com/rladiesglobal) and seek to promote diversity in the R and data science world 💜 
We believe that everyone can code. If you want to get involved (as a presenter or organizer), feel free to reach out! 

The chapter is run by [Cosima Meyer](https://twitter.com/cosima_meyer) and [Gabe Winter](https://twitter.com/gbwinter).
